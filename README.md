## Analysis

Looking at wind speed in both the northern and southern hemisphere you see that 
most wind speeds you can see that most of the speed are under 10 mphs which is enjoyable for vacations.

Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be cooler than those at similar latitudes in the 
Northern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has more ocean and less land.  Water
heats up and cools down more slowly than land.



Humidity is pretty high across all latitudes.
